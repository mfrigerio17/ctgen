This is the reference plain-text backend for the `CtGen`tool.  
Use the switch `-l plaintext` to use it.

This backend generates text with the coordinate transforms coefficients,
in _a_ format somewhat readable by humans. It is not meant to produce working
code.

Instead, the purpose of this backend is:

- to be a reference for the implementation of other backends, because it is
  simple

- to be used for experimentation and unit testing
